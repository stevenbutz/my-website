I am going to embrace the hate that I have so graciously received from the lord and myself. 

It feels great to understand the anger and suffering of the masses and to be one with it. 

For none is without pity. 

I pity the man who projects himself unto others. 

Who creates the stories and the narratives without the traction.

Who paves the road but is not there to step upon it. 

Who is a paradox unto himself 

He know he must break away, and so he does. 

And with that, I shall embrace all that life throws my way. 

From the hate and violence, pain to the love sorrow and joy. 

There is nothing that escapes my breadth in this life 

For it is short and death waits around the corner. 

Patient that one is and smile I do as I greet him. 

You see he is a great friend of mine, just like you. 

You may not like him as I do but he comes for all.

Some weep and others rejoice, but one thing in common is death. 

He deals in absolutes. 

To live is to die and to die is to live. 

You can be mad at life for daring and angry at death for taking but what you can’t do is end either. 

Life will live and death will die. 

The very prospect of these words is testament to their will and concept. 

Their power knows no bounds

To stop one is to end another. 

To jump is to fly and to a is to b. 

There is no 1 without 2. No 3 without 4. 

So why do we insist on matter being single faceted?

It puzzles me. 

There is no single piece, but an array of parts and excuse me a web of interconnected happenings. 

It will all come together. 

And to that we can rejoice. 

The reckoning shall come and all will be nothing. 

The absence of paradox in reality suggests its presence in fiction. 

In to which does not exist. 

Because it is imaginary. 

But keep in mind imagination exists in reality, maybe not as, but does. 

So in imagination there exists reality. 

What a world it would be anyone but this one says the other.

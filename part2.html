Because to the other it never is but is not 

The nature of the paradox, to undo itself. 

Which is why they don’t exist in reality. 

Imagine 1 being 2 or arriving before you left. 

Or, more particularly imagine something different. 

Different rules or laws whatever you may call it. 

We wish for a world without sense and logic because there madness reigns supreme. 
That is what freedom means to me.

And with these pitiful rules and laws I am beheld to I can do just that. 

Which is a blessing no doubt to write on these keys 

Postulate these thoughts 

But it begs the questions 

That which never was

Is a tad more inspiring. 

Because as soon as its played playing played.

Omniscience is no joke but a sick game of happenstance 

And life is but a corner 

Keep your nothing and play play played 

3 2 1 

0 0 0 

So embrace the madness hell on earth has yet to arrive for you and maybe you’ll be one of the lucky ones 

Ancestors be with you. 

Play the game 

Experience life 

Read the words 

Ingest the meaning 

There is and will always be nothing 

So find comfort in something 

Or die alone 

EMBRACE IT
YOU DONT HAVE LONG

Hold it as tight as you can because as soon as you let go 

Its gone 

To live is to have died 

I died on June 6th, 2020. 

Follow me as I pave my path back to life and rediscover what it truly means to be alive 

Until death does us part dear reader

May our triumphs be glorious and our falls be harsh. 
To learn is to live 
To heal is to die peace love and affection care hugs and kisses may the love you deserve find you <3 signing out.
